                 <p>Vannevar Bush wrote the essay "As We May Think" in 1945, but did he predict
                    what would happen in the future. Throughout the essay Bush's describes a techology
                    that works in a similar way as the Web. Bush called the techology the memex. The 
                    memex records information that would then be stored on microfilm.
