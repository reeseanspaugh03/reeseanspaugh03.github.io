        <p class = "textboxb">During the summer I heard from James more than I thought I would. He would send me photos of what he was doing. Around the middle of the summer Inez texted me asking me to meet her. I thought it was strange. She usually never reaches out. I met her for lunch and she told me James was seeing someone else. Some girl he met at the beach town. At first I didnâ€™t want to believe it until she showed me a photo of them together.
