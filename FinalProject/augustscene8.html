            me when he was back in school James's head was elsewhere. I remember waiting outside the rusty door of the toolshed his
            grandparents transformed into his own personal room listening to him on the phone. Again that same girl's name was
            mentioned. I was supposed to meet him there but I couldn't bring myself to knock. So I stood outside his room listening
            to him curse to himself about how he messed something up. I waited another few minutes before I decided he wasn't going to 
            come out to see me. Maybe he forgot about our plans.
