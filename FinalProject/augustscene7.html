        <p class = "textboxa">I spent most of my days and nights with James. I would meet him behind the mall and our
            little adventures would begin. Riding our bikes along the beach, drinking a bottles of wine hoping his 
            grandparents wouldn't notice the missing bottles, just being two complete idiots around this little beach town.
            And while I spent my nights next to him I still chose to ignore how often he would wake up in the middle 
            of the night to check his phone as if he was desperately waiting for someone to reach out.
