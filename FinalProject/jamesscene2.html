        <p class = "textbox"> I took James to the seafood shack. He was so easy to talk to. So easy
            to get lost in his smile. We talked until the sun came down. I drove him home and smiled to
            myself all the way back to my room. He texted me asking to meet him on the beach tomorrow.
