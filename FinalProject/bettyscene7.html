        <p class = "textboxb">The rest of the summer I cried in my room and stopped responding to Jamesâ€™s texts. When school started again James and I were supposed to have the same homeroom, but I needed to switch to correct my schedule. I know James probably assumed it was because of him. Though I was mad at him I wouldn't go that far. I knew when James was ready he would come back to me.
