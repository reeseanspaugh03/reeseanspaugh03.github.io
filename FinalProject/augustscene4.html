        <p class = "textboxa"> I met James on the beach. He waited for me at the entance his hand sheilding his 
            eyes from the sun. He brought a bag with all the beach going essentials including two books one for me and one for him.
            I noticed the book he picked for himself was one I mentioned at the shack the night before. He laid on his stomach
            his back exposed to the sun and while he read so peacefully I wished I could write my name on it.
