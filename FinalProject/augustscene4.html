        <p class = "textboxa">Yesterday on the beach James was determined to find what our spot would be. This led him
            to discover the mall was the perfect equal distance between our homes. So today I met him behind the mall. 
            When he saw me he waved and had the dumbest smile on his face. We ventured into the mall and walked around aimlessly. 
            When the sun started to go down, he asked me if I was sure about all this. I had never been more sure about 
            anything.
