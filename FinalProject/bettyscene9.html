        <p class = "textboxb">I always throw a party around this time of year. But this time one guest would be missing. James would not be in attendance. And though I love my friends I couldn’t help but feel slightly upset about his absence. He drew stars around my scars and made me feel like I was finally someone’s favorite. The party was already two hours in when there was a knock on the door. In my soul I already knew who it was and sure enough when I opened the door James was standing there in my front porch light.
