            I waited in a corner at the dance looking like an idiot waiting for James to show. I finally gave in to someone asking me to dance and tried to make the most of it while my heart was sinking. I stayed the whole time hoping that maybe James was just late. And when I finally returned home the only thing James had to say was in a text where he wrote “sorry you know I hate crowds”
