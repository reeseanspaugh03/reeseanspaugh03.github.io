        <p class = "textboxa">I received a text from James at 11pm asking to meet him at the beach. He added "if you can"
            to make me feel less obligated to go as if that would work on me. He brought a bottle of wine. We drank and were
            both way to honest with each other. He mentioned a girl, but it was so brief I convinced myself I heard him wrong. 
            The summer was slipping away into a moment in time.
