        <p class = "textboxj">When school started again there was only one thing I could think about. 
            How I could get Betty back? Betty always throws a party around the beginning of the school year.
            If I just showed up would Betty have me? Or maybe she would tell me to go screw myself. Or maybe
            she would lead me to the garden. I was constantly thinking about how she would react.
